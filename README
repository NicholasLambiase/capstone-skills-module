This will be the read me file.

In this case I would like to leave a note about branching conventions.
It is best practice to have a written convention for how your repo implements branches so that developers working in the same repo can best avoid collisions.

## Branching Strategies

---

We will be using the State, Release, and Features Branches approach
We will have Long and Short running branches

Long examples: main branch, development branch
Short examples: feature branch

In this model there are no direct commits to long running branches. Only merges and rebases.

#### GitHub Flow

very simple and lean. One long branch plus feature branches

#### GitFlow

Main branch is a reflection of production
Development is the other long branch and has short branched off of it for features. Once we are confident in that release branch we merge it back to Production
